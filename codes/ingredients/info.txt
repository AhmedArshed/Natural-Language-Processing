Natural Language Processing using spacy or anything else.
I have JSON file.

Using Spacy is the best option for me if there is other method you do prefer it's fine too.
Within the column, there are ingredients for each food.
However, in the ingredients, there are unwanted words like
numbers, measurement like cups, teaspoon etc.

I want only real ingredients to be leaf in the column and want to have the final result in JSON format that I could read in my node code.

Desired out put is going to be like below.

{"title":"Christmas Eggnog",
"ingredients":["whites","yolks","sugar","rye","whiskey","brandy","rum","cream"],
"id":"05zEpbSqcs9E0rcnCJWyZ9OgdH0MLby"},

!Important!

ingredients column has to have array having ingredients within an array "Ingredients" : ['a', 'b' ,'c' ,'d']
